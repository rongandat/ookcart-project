                  instructions if user chooses so to do, but user acknowledges 
                  that user does NOT have the right to then blame e-globalcash for 
                  not physically restraining user from doing foolish things with 
                  user&#39;s funds or for not policing the Internet. <br>

                  4.2. Value Limits <br>
                  <br>
                  Issuer may set value limits (balance, spends, etc.) on a 
                  e-globalcash account based on the sufficiency of the identifying

                  <br>
                  4.3.3. Other Administrative Fees ?collected by Issuer for 
                  providing support to User when User contacts Issue rand Issuer 
                  is not at fault. <br>
                  <br>
                  4.3.4. Funds Recovery Process and Fees. <br>
                  <br>
                  Upon satisfying all legal requirements necessary to recover 
                  funds, e-globalcash will, if at all possible, attempt to recover 
                  the funds in question. Common legal requirements include, but 
                  not limited to: valid court orders, valid law enforcement 
                  orders, notarized copies of all requests submitted in writing 
                  and notarized copies of all IDs. Inmost cases all originals 
                  have to be submitted via postal mail, as electronic copies 
                  sent by e-mail are not acceptable. If by any reason e-globalcash 
                  is requested to recover any funds by any reason, a one-time 
                  10% Recovery fee will be charged in order to cover any and all 
                  expenses of the recovery process. <br>

                  4.4. Escheat <br>

                  enactment. <br>

                  <br>
                  4.6.1.1.Issuer will Freeze the e-globalcash account of User if

                  corrupting the security or functionality of the e-globalcash 
                  system. Additionally, User will be subject to damage sand 
                  other penalties, including criminal prosecution where 
                  available and the notification of the general public of User's actions, at the sole discretion of Issuer. <br>
                  <br>
                  4.6.1.2.Issuer will Freeze or remove a Freeze from a e-globalcash 
                  account, if ordered to do so by an order from a court or
