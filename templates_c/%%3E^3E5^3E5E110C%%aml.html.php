<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Money laundering 
  is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal 
  or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so 
  that the unlawful proceeds appear to have been derived from 
  legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, 
  money laundering occurs in three stages: (1) cash first enters 
  the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage, where the cash 
  generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary 
  instruments, such as money orders or traveler&#39;s checks, or 
  deposited into accounts at financial institutions; (2) at the 
  &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are transferred or moved into 
  other accounts or other financial institutions to further 
  separate the money from its criminal origin; and (3) at the 
  &quot;integration&quot; stage, the funds are reintroduced into the 
  economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund 
  other criminal activities or legitimate businesses. Terrorist 
  financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, 
  but rather attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of 
  the funds, which will later be used for criminal purposes.
